# FFL Commerce - Wordpress Plugin
FFL Commerce is an eCommerce plugin built for the Wordpress CMS. It is a static fork of the popular Jigoshop plugin modified to add functionality needed for eCommerce sites owned by Gunshops or Federal Firearms Licensees. Unlike traditional eCommerce the FFL Dealer has a set of specific requirements that are needed to satisfy BATF rules and regulations.
